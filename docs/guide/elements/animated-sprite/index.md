# AnimatedSprite

Creates a [AnimatedSprite](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.AnimatedSprite.html)

A simple way to display an animation depicted by a list of textures.

I recommend using spritesheets created by TexturePacker ([they have a great tutorial on it](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/tutorials/how-to-create-sprite-sheets-and-animations-with-pixijs)). If you donâ€™t want to use spritesheets, you can simply just pass in an array of your desired textures.
