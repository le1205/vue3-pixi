# NineSlicePlane

Creates a [NineSlicePlane](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.NineSlicePlane.html)

Allows you to stretch a texture using 9-slice scaling. The corners will remain unscaled (useful for buttons with rounded corners for example) and the other areas will be scaled horizontally and or vertically
