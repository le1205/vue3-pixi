# Container

Creates a [Container](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.Container.html)

A Container is the base component for all components that render to the screen. It can be used on its own, but components such as Sprite or Graphics will be composed of Containers

When child components are rendered inside, their coordinates become local to the parent Container.
